At waking time, the sun was no doubt laughing up there in the pastures, too far
for us to dream about. Down here, we were caught in a violent current of
sulphurous air, and I felt in my bones the same indescribable terror as every
time, an irrepressible darkness in the soul, when a fighter plane screamed just
above our heads, condemning the neighbouring valley to the flames of a hell we
knew only too well.

"Let us take out by force this despicable scum who threaten to assault the
Unspunnen Stone!" such had been the words of the Corps Commander to our
multitude, a carefree magma of motionless privates covering the plains of the
Mittelland – corpses already, almost all of them, although few of us knew. When
_Le Temps_ published, despite the reluctance of the editorial staff, and only
after repeated threats of mass resignation from journalists, army documents
containing eradication plans emanating directly from the Federal Council, and
addressed to the general himself, "to be carried out manually by you, restoring
for its implementation of the ancient slaughter arts techniques", without
hesitating to specify "that we should not fear the annoying objections of
cantons, nor the fiscal pitfalls that every patriot encounters in the diligent
implementation of these measures", one had screamed bloody murder, as one
ought to, but no one really took the matter seriously.

*And even as the crisis worsened, and risked tipping the industrial societies
in what 22<sup>nd</sup>-century historians would call the "Age of Turbulence" –
unless, each to all other alike, they adopt an agreed term, like "planetisation
of chaos", to designate the emerging flow of centuries of repression and legal
obscurantism in store for us, I did not worry. I didn't worry about anything
any more, it is true.* In the past, I had feared being impure and ridiculous.
Worse, I had been shy about what people would say. To my great surprise, I
would not remain so. I had tried to break these chains by the sheer force of my
will, but in vain. I then experienced the dull taste of resignation, and I
became convinced that this would be my slimming diet forever. Yet, ever since
the idea of hatred had manifested itself on the world stage, and since our
country, like the others by the way, had as its only passion, its only fever,
to find a way to cross the forbidden line beyond of which there is nothing but
utopia, I no longer blushed.

I saw only too well where we were not to go over, once again, mentally, like a
protective mantra, the stages of the Hegelian architecture. My heart had my
mouth whisper these words so grey, so abstract, so intimate, while my mind made
my eyes shed tears of hope drenched with blood.

Mechanist at heart, and at first sorry for my strange complicity with the
Organicists in my section, I couldn't help but feel pity for my unfortunate
companions, whom I knew were, just like myself, headed for the mass grave. I
slowly realised, despite the bombs and the blaze, that I had become friends
with those whom, despite everything, I would come to call my ancestors.

For although I loved them ardently, I could not say that it was friendship that
had united us until then. On the contrary, it was in our very enmity,
undoubtedly the fuel of our mutual fascination, that I had found happiness
during the first years of mobilisation.

In the year 2000, when everything changed, I was twenty-two years old. My only
desire, then, was to achieve this higher level of effort required, it seemed to
me, to explain myself, to know myself, to have faith in my attempts, to live! I
threw myself into this enterprise without any ulterior motives, obeying, for
the first time since the emergence of my consciousness, more than fifteen years
before, all the dispositions aroused in me by the unnatural dance of shame
and pride.

My life had been dismal, and my goals had remained stubbornly unthinkable. The
war was, after all, just another misfortune. However, during this time of
turmoil, I understood something about the man I was going to become – this
annoying double into whom, willy-nilly, I was going to have to transmigrate.

My parents' attitude towards me, long unfathomable, now appeared to me clear as
day. All too often, in my selfishness and bitterness, I had exhausted my
mother, already quite humiliated by the torments of work and the surly
ignorance of men. Even the way I adored myself, then an insurmountable
obstacle, seemed to have purged itself, and I noticed with astonishment, each
time that I was in love with *this or that woman, with whom I dreamt of
satisfying this or that fantasy*, the craze with which I welcomed the great
influence she would have on my personal life. I had already thought about all
this when leaving high school, wondering more and more what had prevented me
from bonding with anyone, but that did not change anything. And suddenly
everything became clear, as if these questions hadn't even existed.

I felt something almost beyond happiness: it was joy, a violent joy, often
uncontrollable. I was consumed by thirst at all times. The situation was
serious. I was drinking milk every five hours, and couldn't suppress cravings
for instant Chinese soups. What was to be done? My decision was as sudden as it
was irrevocable. I knew it was them, my chosen ancestors, always with me in
thought, who gave me the necessary strength. I left Lausanne, never to return.
