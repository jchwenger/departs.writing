I left Lausanne, never to return. You won't know where I set off to. I won't
tell you in which city I died either, only a few years ago. Perhaps you will
look for me in vain somewhere on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, in some
crevice of a cliff in Brittany, at the bottom of an Alpine tunnel, or on the
blinding ice of a Norwegian beach... Will you persist? Will you try your luck
on this or that Caribbean island where I had established myself some time after
leaving London, or in the shabby hotel at dry port of Khorgos, on the
Sino-Kazakh border, where one of those old industrial dreams, that had haunted
me so much before my years of Scottish exile, had led me? One thing is for sure,
you will not find me.

The only advice I can give you is to do nothing, except to let yourself be
carried away by the course of things. When you hear these words, no doubt a lot
of things will have changed, and not necessarily for the better. The world, I
am sure, will have taken a turn that will not please you. Who knows, the world
will have perhaps finally reached the crisis to which it had been promised for
such a long time. Knowing it, it might even have liked being reconquered by the
demons. Then, you will be able to blame yourself, as much as you want, for not
having had the courage to give in to temptation, for not having been more
fanatical in your career, for not to having more lightly, more fully!,
dedicated your body and your soul to the destruction of this frozen world in
which you never believed.

*But even as the crisis worsens, and risks tipping industrial societies in what
22<sup>nd</sup>-century historians of the  will call the "Age of Turbulence" –
unless, each to all others alike, they adopt an agreed term, like
"planetization of chaos", to designate the emerging flow of centuries of
repression and legal obscurantism waiting for us – I do not worry. I don't
worry about anything any more, it is true,* especially since the loss of my
unfortunate friends, you know well which ones, whose fall, at the end of my
urban years, caused me so much sadness. But I digress. What I want to tell you
is that many attempts to act will continue to fail: yours, mine, theirs, and I
was never naive enough to believe that the increased assets of a few, and the
growing credit of all the others, could have changed anything to the gaping
hole left by the determinations of History, or would suffice to save the world
from itself.

As in the past, you won't have to choose which side of the coming war you will
fall in with – as in the past in our fights –, nor which side the interest of
your heart will lean towards, as if there always had to be a side.

For sure, if you follow my advice, if you guide your steps on the path that I
have patiently mapped out for you, and as long as you do not get stuck in the
impasse of chasing my ghost, you won't have to choose. You will finally accept
what you never wanted to do. You will have to live with your own ideas, that
will not be mine, even if they are the ones that created the cradle in which
they were born. You will know the future.

You will limit yourself, you will have to, to maintaining a modest neutrality,
to shelter yourself as long as possible in the reassuring counterpoint of
laments that the populations of your mind will be more constrained than never
to moan, the back bent, the shoulders broken, the mind automatic. Will you
blame yourself for it to no end? Or will they have revolted, by some miracle,
these crawling creatures of your totalitarian imaginaries? I cannot know that,
even if I cannot guarantee that no one will wake up, in the end, one day or
another, from the numbness of your psychic world.

If I'm not mistaken, everything I said in this message is at the end of the day
nothing but a lure intended to convince you to detach your eyes from the events
that will play themselves out again and again before your eyes, in order for
you to turn inwards. I anticipate that, as always, you will believe you have
met *this or that woman, with whom you will dream of satisfying this or that
fantasy*. I approve, you know me, and yet, it's stronger than me, I am getting
bored. It's in these moments that I see you return to your already
well-established life, or well on the way to being so, in Paris, and get back
to your old habits.

Just promise me one thing. Even when you feel won over by resignation and
depression – please don't contradict me, I know you to be the slave of these
sirens –, trust me, take my advice, don't you worry, let yourself go. Because
it is only in these moments, caressing with a dying finger the bottom of the
abyss, that you will have a chance of stumbling on one of those dark pearls
that gleam in the depths. You will then perhaps think again about the happiness
you once knew in the comfort of my ficklness, and you will finally weep,
after a life of drought.
